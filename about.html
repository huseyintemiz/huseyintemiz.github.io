<div class="w-100">
	<p>ðŸ‘¾ I am HÃ¼seyin Temiz, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University, with a strong research focus on realistic human body recovery under motion. My expertise spans human motion analysis, 3D avatar systems, and real-time applications of generative AI, including Gaussian Splat-based representations. I specialize in building full-stack avatar and chat systems capable of real-time interaction and streaming. My academic background is grounded in computer vision and deep generative models such as VQ-VAEs and diffusion models. In industry, Iâ€™ve worked as a Machine Learning Engineer, improving inference performance for generative photo editing applications. I actively contribute to academia through research, teaching, and publications on pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Iâ€™m also passionate about science outreach and volunteer in educational programs for children in underserved communities. I bring a well-rounded skill set in 3D computer vision, deep learning, and systems engineering, with a strong commitment to innovation, collaboration, and impactful research.</p>
