# Spherical Harmonics in Gaussian Splats

## ðŸ”¸ Why Use Spherical Harmonics in Gaussian Splats?

When rendering 3D scenes using Gaussian splats, each point (or "splat") needs to represent not just **color**, but how that color **changes depending on the viewing direction**. Spherical harmonics allow encoding this angular variation compactly.

This is important for achieving **photorealistic rendering** with effects like:
- Specular highlights
- Soft shadows
- View-dependent lighting changes

## ðŸ”¸ What Are Spherical Harmonics?

**Spherical Harmonics (SH)** are a series of **orthogonal basis functions** defined on the surface of a sphere. You can think of them as the 3D analog of **Fourier series** for functions on a sphere.

They are indexed by:
- **Degree (l)**: controls the frequency (higher means more detail)
- **Order (m)**: varies from `-l` to `+l`

### Example Levels:
- **SH level 0 (SH0):** Only constant color (no view dependence)
- **SH level 1 (SH1):** Basic directional lighting (like Lambertian)
- **SH level 2 or 3+:** Captures more complex angular dependencies

## ðŸ”¸ SH in Gaussian Splatting

Each 3D Gaussian stores:
- Position, scale, rotation, opacity
- **Spherical Harmonics coefficients for RGB appearance**

Instead of storing just a single RGB color, we store a **set of SH coefficients per color channel**. When rendering:
1. Compute the **viewing direction** `v` for each Gaussian.
2. Evaluate the **SH basis functions** at direction `v` to get a vector `SH_basis(v)`.
3. Compute the final color as a dot product:

```
color = Î£ (c_i * SH_basis_i(v))   for i = 1..n
```

where `c_i` are SH coefficients.

## ðŸ”¸ SH Level Examples

| SH Level | # Coefficients (per color) | What it Captures                  |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0        | 1                          | Constant color                    |
| 1        | 4                          | Directional diffuse lighting      |
| 2        | 9                          | Soft shadows, simple specular     |
| 3        | 16                         | Rich angular detail               |

So if SH=2:
- You store 9 SH coefficients per color channel (27 total for RGB).
- You can model how color changes with view angle in a smooth and efficient way.

## ðŸ”¸ Visual Example (Simplified)

Imagine a glossy red ball:

- **Without SH (SH=0):** The ball is flat red from all directions.
- **With SH=1:** The ball appears brighter on the side facing the light source.
- **With SH=2+:** The ball has soft reflections and looks more realistic as you move the camera.

## ðŸ”¸ Dummy Python Code Example

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import sph_harm

# Dummy view direction (theta, phi) in spherical coordinates
theta = np.pi / 4  # angle from z-axis
phi = np.pi / 3    # angle from x-axis in x-y plane

# Compute SH basis up to degree l=2
def compute_sh_basis(theta, phi, l_max=2):
    basis = []
    for l in range(l_max + 1):
        for m in range(-l, l + 1):
            Y_lm = sph_harm(m, l, phi, theta).real  # Only real part used in graphics
            basis.append(Y_lm)
    return np.array(basis)

# Example SH coefficients for RGB (assuming SH2 = 9 coeffs per channel)
sh_coeffs_r = np.random.rand(9)
sh_coeffs_g = np.random.rand(9)
sh_coeffs_b = np.random.rand(9)

# Evaluate SH basis
sh_basis = compute_sh_basis(theta, phi)

# Final RGB color (dot product of SH coefficients and SH basis)
r = np.dot(sh_coeffs_r, sh_basis)
g = np.dot(sh_coeffs_g, sh_basis)
b = np.dot(sh_coeffs_b, sh_basis)

print(f"RGB color from SH: R={r:.2f}, G={g:.2f}, B={b:.2f}")
```

This code shows:
- How SH basis functions are computed using `scipy.special.sph_harm`
- How SH coefficients are applied to compute view-dependent color

## ðŸ”¸ Summary

In **Gaussian Splatting**, Spherical Harmonics:
- Encode how color/appearance changes with view direction
- Provide a compact way to achieve realistic rendering
- Are used per-splat (each Gaussian has its own SH coefficients)

You can **trade off quality vs speed** by choosing the SH level (e.g., SH=0 for fast rendering, SH=2+ for better realism).
