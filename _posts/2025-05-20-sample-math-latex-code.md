When rendering 3D scenes using Gaussian splats, each point (or "splat") needs to represent not just **color**, but how that color **changes depending on the viewing direction**. Spherical harmonics allow encoding this angular variation compactly.

This is important for achieving **photorealistic rendering** with effects like:
- Specular highlights
- Soft shadows
- View-dependent lighting changes

## ðŸ”¸ What Are Spherical Harmonics?

**Spherical Harmonics (SH)** are a series of **orthogonal basis functions** defined on the surface of a sphere. You can think of them as the 3D analog of **Fourier series** for functions on a sphere.

They are indexed by:
- **Degree (l)**: controls the frequency (higher means more detail)
- **Order (m)**: varies from `-l` to `+l`

### Example Levels:
- **SH level 0 (SH0):** Only constant color (no view dependence)
- **SH level 1 (SH1):** Basic directional lighting (like Lambertian)
- **SH level 2 or 3+:** Captures more complex angular dependencies

## ðŸ”¸ SH in Gaussian Splatting

Each 3D Gaussian stores:
- Position, scale, rotation, opacity
- **Spherical Harmonics coefficients for RGB appearance**

Instead of storing just a single RGB color, we store a **set of SH coefficients per color channel**. When rendering:
1. Compute the **viewing direction** `v` for each Gaussian.
2. Evaluate the **SH basis functions** at direction `v` to get a vector `SH_basis(v)`.
3. Compute the final color as a dot product:

$$
C(v) = \sum_{l=0}^{L} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} c_{l,m} \cdot Y_{l,m}(v)
$$

Where:
- $$ C(v) $$ : The final color for the viewing direction $$ v $$.
- $$c_{l,m}$$: The SH coefficients for each degree $$ l $$ and order $$ m $$.
- $$ Y_{l,m}(v) $$: The SH basis functions evaluated at the direction $$ v $$.

## ðŸ”¸ Key Spherical Harmonics Equations

### SH Basis Functions

The real-valued spherical harmonics basis functions are defined as:

$$
Y_{l}^{m}(\theta, \phi) = N_{l}^{m} \cdot P_{l}^{m}(\cos\theta) \cdot 
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{2} \sin(|m|\phi) & \text{if } m < 0 \\
1 & \text{if } m = 0 \\
\sqrt{2} \cos(m\phi) & \text{if } m > 0
\end{cases}
$$

Where:
- $$ \theta $$ : inclination (angle from the z-axis)
- $$ \phi $$: azimuth (angle from the x-axis in the x-y plane)
- $$ N_{l}^{m} $$: normalization constant
- $$ P_{l}^{m} $$: associated Legendre polynomial

### Normalization Constant

$$
N_{l}^{m} = \sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{(l - |m|)!}{(l + |m|)!}}
$$

### Example: SH0 and SH1

- **SH0 (l=0, m=0):**
    $$
    Y_0^0 = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}}
    $$

- **SH1 (l=1, m=-1,0,1):**
    $$
    Y_1^{-1} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}} \sin\theta \sin\phi
    $$
    $$
    Y_1^{0} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}} \cos\theta
    $$
    $$
    Y_1^{1} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}} \sin\theta \cos\phi
    $$
