# Spherical Harmonics in Gaussian Splats

## ðŸ”¸ Why Use Spherical Harmonics in Gaussian Splats?

When rendering 3D scenes using Gaussian splats, each point (or "splat") needs to represent not just **color**, but how that color **changes depending on the viewing direction**. Spherical harmonics allow encoding this angular variation compactly.

This is important for achieving **photorealistic rendering** with effects like:
- Specular highlights
- Soft shadows
- View-dependent lighting changes

## ðŸ”¸ What Are Spherical Harmonics?

**Spherical Harmonics (SH)** are a series of **orthogonal basis functions** defined on the surface of a sphere. You can think of them as the 3D analog of **Fourier series** for functions on a sphere.

They are indexed by:
- **Degree (l)**: controls the frequency (higher means more detail)
- **Order (m)**: varies from `-l` to `+l`

### Example Levels:
- **SH level 0 (SH0):** Only constant color (no view dependence)
- **SH level 1 (SH1):** Basic directional lighting (like Lambertian)
- **SH level 2 or 3+:** Captures more complex angular dependencies

## ðŸ”¸ SH in Gaussian Splatting

Each 3D Gaussian stores:
- Position, scale, rotation, opacity
- **Spherical Harmonics coefficients for RGB appearance**

Instead of storing just a single RGB color, we store a **set of SH coefficients per color channel**. When rendering:
1. Compute the **viewing direction** `v` for each Gaussian.
2. Evaluate the **SH basis functions** at direction `v` to get a vector `SH_basis(v)`.
3. Compute the final color as a dot product:
